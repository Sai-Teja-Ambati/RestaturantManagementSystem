# Restaurant Management System

Comprehensive restaurant backend system managing orders, inventory, table bookings, and user roles with robust authentication and authorization.

---

## ðŸš€ Quick Start with Docker

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed (or Rancher Desktop)
- Git installed

### Initial Setup and Build
For the **first-time build** or if you want to rebuild images, run:

```docker-compose --profile migrations up --build```


This command builds Docker images, launches PostgreSQL, runs database migrations, and starts the backend app.

### Starting Containers (No Rebuild)
For **subsequent runs** without the need to rebuild images, simply run:

```docker-compose --profile migrations up```


### Stopping Containers
Gracefully stop all running containers:

```docker-compose down```


### Stopping and Cleaning Up
To stop running containers **and remove associated volumes and orphaned containers**, run:

```docker-compose down -v --remove-orphans```

## Installation

### Requirements
- Rancher Desktop or Docker Desktop for container management
- Git version control
- Java 17 or later for local builds (optional if using Docker)
- PostgreSQL 13+ (handled automatically in Docker)
- Maven 3.6+ (optional if using Docker)

### Setup Steps
1. Clone the repository:
```git clone git@github.com:Sai-Teja-Ambati/RestaurantManagementSystem.git```


2. Setup database credentials in `application.properties` or environment variables as needed.

3. Build and run:
- For first-time build with migrations:
  ```
  docker-compose --profile migrations up --build
  ```
- For restarting containers without rebuild:
  ```
  docker-compose --profile migrations up
  ```

4. Access the backend REST API at:

```http://localhost:8080/```

## System Architecture

- **Controller Layer:** Exposes REST API endpoints secured by Spring Security.
- **Service Layer:** Encapsulates business logic for authentication, user, order, table, and booking management.
- **Repository Layer:** Interfaces with PostgreSQL via Spring Data JPA.
- **Security:** JWT-based stateless authentication with role-based authorization.
- **Validation and Exception Handling:** Bean validation with custom exceptions and global handlers.
- **Transaction Management:** Ensures data integrity in multi-step operations.

---

## Features

- **Authentication & Authorization**
- JWT token issuance and validation
- Role-restricted endpoint access
- User registration with role validation

- **User Management**
- CRUD operations for users by Admin
- User role assignment and checks

- **Menu Management**
- Add, update, delete menu items & categories
- Search and filter by price and category

- **Order Processing**
- Order creation with item and quantity validation
- Status transitions (Placed â†’ InKitchen â†’ Served)
- Billing calculations and inventory updates

- **Table Management**
- Create, update, remove tables
- Track table statuses: Available, Occupied, Reserved
- Find best fit table for required capacity

- **Reservation System**
- Time-slot based table bookings with conflict checks
- Update and cancel bookings with effects on table status

- **Inventory Management**
- Fetch current inventory and auto-update after orders
- Restore inventory from saved files
- Alert on low and out-of-stock items

- **Analytics and Reporting**
- Order statistics, inventory levels, and usage patterns
- Dashboard accessible to Admin users

---

## Database Structure

- **Users:** Holds user details and their role.
- **MenuItems:** Catalog of menu dishes with pricing.
- **Orders:** Track customer orders and status.
- **OrderItems:** Join orders with ordered menu items.
- **RestaurantTables:** Details including capacity and status.
- **TableReservations:** Records for booking and reservation management.
- **InventoryItems:** Tracks ingredient quantities.

---

## Workflow Overview

### User Authentication

1. User submits login credentials.
2. System authenticates and returns JWT token if valid.
3. Role-based menu and API access is enforced using token claims.

### Order Lifecycle

1. Waiter creates new order assigned to a table.
2. Items are added with quantity and availability checks.
3. Inventory quantities decrease as order progresses.
4. Order moves through statuses (Placed â†’ In Kitchen â†’ Served).
5. Table status updates accordingly.

### Table Booking Flow

1. Customer requests a booking for a table at a specific time.
2. System verifies availability without conflicts.
3. Booking stored; table status updated if booking is current.
4. Bookings can be modified or cancelled respecting time constraints.
